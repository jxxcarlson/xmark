## Preamble

The XMark project spans three areas, all related:

1. MiniLaTeX
2. Markdown+Math
3. XMark proper

The last, which is experimental, is the most interesting and least developed.  The aim is to develop a modern language that has many of the features of LaTeX, but is simpler, more regular, and has a formal definition.  We aim to provide it with a modern IDE that features real-time rendering of source text to HTML and various export options including standard LaTeX.  The site [minilatex.io](https://minilatex.io) demonstrates some of these ideas in the context of (1) and (2)

## To Do Lists

### BlockParser Todos

- [x] A block parser
- [x] A repl for testing
- [ ] System for using different language definitions
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] An inline parser
- [ ] A renderer, say to HTML
- [ ] Integration with the elm-editor project


### Elm Editor Todos

This project still needs a lot of work. Collaborate with Swendude?  I would like to see a much better interface that looks a lot like Markdown Pro. 

### Math Markdown Todos

Should be redone using using BlockParser

### MiniLaTeX Todos

Should be redone using using BlockParser

### XMark Todos
